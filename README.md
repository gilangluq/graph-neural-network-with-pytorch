# graph-neural-network-with-pytorch
 This repository will introduce key concepts of deep learning on graphs using Graph Neural Networks, specifically with the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) library. PyTorch Geometric is an extension of the widely-used deep learning framework PyTorch, providing a range of methods and utilities that simplify the development of Graph Neural Networks.
